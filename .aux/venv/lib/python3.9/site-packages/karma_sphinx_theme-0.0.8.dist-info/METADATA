# Karma Sphinx Theme

A simple responsive theme for sphinx. This theme is in it's early stage of development so only 
contains limited options.

## Installing

```
pip install karma_sphinx_theme
```

## Configuration

The theme's project-wide options are defined in the `karma_sphinx_theme/theme.conf`
file, and can be defined in your project's `conf.py` via
`html_theme_options`. For example:

```
html_theme_options = {
    'navigation_depth': 2,
    'includehidden': True,
    'titles_only': False
}
```

## Options

* `navigation_depth` Int. Indicate the max depth of the tree, by default, 2 levels are included.
* `includehidden` Bool. Specifies if the sidebar includes toctrees marked with the `:hidden:` option
* `titles_only` Bool. If True, removes headers within a page from the sidebar.
